// Command mise-seo is how a Go web app's repo answers search engines, from its seo.toml (found up from the working
// directory): the live site audited as Googlebot reads it, Lighthouse on Google's servers, the README's badges, and
// Google Search Console. A repo gets it as it gets mise-intl: a binary on mise-seo's GitHub releases (goreleaser,
// .goreleaser.yaml), which mise installs at the release the repo's .mise/config.toml pins (github:joeblew999/mise-seo).
// The app imports mise-seo's packages from the same release's Go module. Each command is a task too
// (.mise/tasks/mise-seo.toml, which mise-seo init writes): mise run seo:<command> runs mise-seo <command>, and mise run
// seo says which to run next.
//
// Each command is a file of its own, holding the method named for it (audit.go holds audit), so misecheck holds every
// task of the template to the Go it runs, both ways. mise-seo show-help lists them.
//
// Exit codes are the contract between tasks: 0 ok, 1 problems (or no access), 2 usage. --json prints one JSON document
// on stdout instead of text (the same data, for agents, CI and jq) and never opens a browser.

// both) to them, word for word.
