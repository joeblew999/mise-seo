A mise tool repo, made by ` + "`mise-seo new-tool " + module + "`" + ` from mise-seo ` + from + `: the ` + "`" + name + "`" + ` binary
(` + "`cmd/" + name + "/`" + `), its template (` + "`templates/`" + `), its walks, its release and its CI, as mise-seo's are.

## Next

1. ` + "`mise install`, then `mise run root:ci`" + `: what its CI runs, here the same. It passes as it comes.
2. Its commands are mise-seo's, renamed: keep those the tool needs. To remove one, delete its file,
   ` + "`cmd/" + name + "/<command>.go`" + `, and run ` + "`mise run root:ci`" + `: misecheck names its task, its skill row and its docs row
   still left.
3. Write the tool's own: a file per command in ` + "`cmd/" + name + "/`" + `, its row in ` + "`var commands`" + ` in ` + "`main.go`" + `, its task in
   ` + "`templates/.mise/tasks/" + name + ".toml`" + `, and its rows in the template's skill and docs. misecheck names each one missing.
4. Replace this README with the tool's own: the problem it solves, and what it does.

mise-seo is used here as in any repo, through its own tasks, which new-tool wrote with ` + "`mise-seo init`" + `:
` + "`mise run mise-seo`" + ` (what's done, what's next), ` + "`mise-seo:check`" + `, ` + "`mise-seo:update`" + ` (every pin, mise-seo's two at
one release). ` + "`docs/mise-seo/README.md`" + ` has all of it. ` + "`mise tasks`" + ` lists every task here. CLAUDE.md loads this README.
