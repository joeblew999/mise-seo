// verify is mise-seo verify: what the repo's GitHub workflow runs once it has checked out and installed mise. First
// each kind of pin the updates move is checked consistent with what pins it, as the updates leave them: the packages
// with their lockfile (aube install --frozen-lockfile, which fails when package.json and the lockfile differ) and every
// go.mod with its code (go mod tidy -diff -e, which fails when go.mod or go.sum aren't what the imports need, and goes
// on past a package the repo's setup generates, which a fresh checkout doesn't have yet); mise's tools
// are pinned exactly in the mise files, which are their own lock. Then the repo's own setup and test tasks when it has
// them, then check. Run here, it does what GitHub does.
