// yet (no main.go, nor the template's app/main.go), so the repo runs straight away. It never writes over a file: a
// repo with a program of its own gets none of it, and a mise.toml of the repo's own is left as it is, with what to
// add. README.md, the repo's front page, goes in whenever the repo has none, under the repo's name.
